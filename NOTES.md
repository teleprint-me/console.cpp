# console.cpp notes

## Observations

Observations about the limitations and potential issues with the current approach to handling control characters, particularly the "stickiness" of these characters and the limited access to previous lines, are valid concerns that can impact usability and flexibility of the console input system.

### Short-Term Remedy: Using `ESC` as a Root Control Character

- **Pros**: This approach simplifies the control character scheme by leveraging a character that's rarely used in standard input scenarios, thus minimizing the risk of interfering with regular user input. It's a quick fix that can be implemented with minimal changes to the current codebase.
- **Cons**: While it reduces the immediate complexity and addresses some issues with control characters, it doesn't fundamentally solve the limitations related to input history manipulation or the ability to implement more sophisticated input handling features. Additionally, relying on a single control character might not scale well as the complexity of input commands or the need for additional control sequences grows.

### Long-Term Remedy: Implementing a Buffer or Stream for Input Modes

- **Pros**: This solution offers a robust and scalable way to handle complex input scenarios, including multiline editing, command history, and sophisticated control sequences. It allows for a more intuitive user experience, akin to what's found in advanced shells or text editors, and provides a solid foundation for future features and enhancements.
- **Cons**: The implementation will be significantly more complex and time-consuming. It requires a thorough redesign of the input handling system, including potentially significant changes to the console state management and user interface logic. This complexity also introduces more potential for bugs and requires extensive testing.

### Plans for Moving Forward

Given current priorities and the extensive task list for the larger project, it might be prudent to implement the short-term remedy for now, with a plan to revisit the input handling system for a more comprehensive overhaul in the future. This approach allows for addressing immediate usability concerns without diverting excessive resources away from other critical components of the project.

1. **Implement the `ESC` Root Control Character**: Short-term, adopt the `ESC` character as a root control character, document its usage clearly, and ensure it meets the immediate needs for console input handling.
   
2. **Plan for Future Refinement**: Document the limitations of the current system and outline a roadmap for the eventual implementation of a buffered or streamed input mode system. This documentation will be valuable both for future reference and for any developers who may work on the project.

3. **Focus on Core Components**: Continue prioritizing the larger, more critical components of the project, ensuring that the console system's current state does not become a bottleneck or distraction from more pressing development tasks.

This balanced approach allows maintaining progress on the project while setting the stage for future improvements to the console system when time and resources allow.
